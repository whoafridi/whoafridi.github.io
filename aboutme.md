👋 **Hi there!** I'm _Md. Rafiuzzaman Bhuiyan Afridi_. Here's a brief journey through my learning, work, and passion for tech.

---

## 🧭 Step 1: Early Academic Curiosity & Research

During my student years at **Daffodil International University (DIU)**, I became involved with the **DIU NLP & ML Research Lab**. There, I contributed as a **core team member**, working on projects like:

- Building a **state-of-the-art Bangla Question Answering System**
- Publishing **multiple research papers**, some of which were accepted in international conferences

📌 These experiences sparked my deep interest in:

- 🔬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)
- 🧠 Deep Learning
- 👁 Computer Vision
- 📊 Data Mining

## 👨‍🏫 Step 2: Mentorship & Teaching Assistantship

As part of giving back to the academic community:

- I served as a **Teacher Assistant** in the **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course under the CSE department.
- I also contributed as a **Resource Person** in the [Python For All](https://www.facebook.com/groups/191702245271190/about/) community — helping learners by delivering lectures and solving problems.

## 💻 Step 3: Entry into Professional World

My first industry exposure started at:

### 🔹 [RoseTech Solutions Ltd.](https://www.rosetech.dev/)

- **Position:** Junior Web Developer
- At RoseTech Solutions Ltd., I started my professional journey as a Junior Web Developer, where I had the opportunity to work on a variety of real-world client projects.

During my time there, I was actively involved in building:

- Content Management Systems (CMS)

- EdTech platforms (e-learning solutions)

- Personal and Business Portfolio websites

Other custom-built web applications

I worked mostly with the Next.js framework and modern frontend tools to deliver responsive, high-performance web solutions tailored to client needs. I collaborated closely with designers and backend developers to transform ideas into fully functional products — ensuring pixel-perfect implementation, optimized load times, and a seamless user experience.

This experience helped me bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry application.

## 💼 Step 4: Growing as a Front-End Developer

Currently, I am working at:

### 🔸 [Debonair Group](https://debonairgroupbd.com/)

- **Position:** Front-End Developer
- Here I work with modern JavaScript frameworks and focus on building responsive, scalable, and maintainable UIs. I contribute to building and maintaining in-house ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solutions that support the operational backbone of the organization.

In this role, I work extensively with modern JavaScript frameworks like React.js, focusing on:

- Developing responsive and user-friendly interfaces

- Ensuring scalability and performance optimization

- Maintaining large-scale ERP modules (e.g. HR, inventory, production)

- Collaborating with backend teams to integrate APIs smoothly

- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and UI consistency

My day-to-day involves writing clean, reusable code and continuously improving user experience across our internal platforms. This role has given me deep insight into how real-world enterprise applications are designed, scaled, and maintained over time.

It’s a dynamic environment where I not only code but also help solve real business problems through intuitive frontend solutions.

## 🧾 Step 5: Creative Contributions

Aside from web development, I have also contributed to creative marketplaces as a:

- **Co-author** at [Template Monster](https://www.templatemonster.com/elementor-templates/yoga-bay-elementor-template-kit-343938.html)  
  — where I helped design and develop Elementor-based UI templates.

## 📚 Step 6: Ongoing Learning

Learning never stops for me. I continuously upskill myself in both **frontend** and **backend** technologies:

### 🔧 Web Development Stack I'm Learning:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Additional Interests:** System Design, Software Architecture
